  <h1>Mikey Kane</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio site!</p>
  <p>There's not much to see here right now, but in time, I'll update this as I 
    improve my web development skills. While I have a reletively small amount of 
    experience in both front-end and back-end development, most of programming experience 
    have predominantly been in Java and Python.</p>
  <p>My experience in Web Development, however, has largely been from "jumping in the deep end" and learning as I go. So I decided to go back and
    relearn the fundamentals. To fill in the gaps so to speak. So far I've been using 
    codecademy as a resource. I find the quizes, lessons and projects helpful. 
    Right now, I already feel much more confident in my use of HTML and CSS. </p>
  <p>Ultimately, I intend to build my own tech stack but for now I'm focusing on improving
    my skills in Front-End Development. The following sections are simply me cateloging 
    the projects I've done in codecademy.
