  <h1>Mikey Kane</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio site!</p>
  <p>There's not much to see here right now, but in time, I'll update this as I 
    improve my web development skills. While I have a reletively small amount of 
    experience in both front-end and back-end development, most of programming experience 
    have predominantly been in Java and Python.</p>
  <p>My experience in Web Development, however, has largely been from "jumping in the deep end" 
    and learning as I go. So I decided to go back and relearn the fundamentals. To fill in the gaps 
    so to speak. So far I've been using codecademy as a resource. I find the quizes, lessons and 
    projects helpful. Right now, I already feel much more confident in my use of HTML and CSS. </p>
  <p>Ultimately, I intend to build my own tech stack but for now I'm focusing on improving
    my skills in Front-End Development. </p>
  <p>The following sections are simply a catelog of
    the projects I've done in codecademy. Specifically, I'm uploading the "challenge projects". 
    Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, these projects contain a series of open-ended requirements 
    to describe the project I'll be building. Each new website, I build a new project from scratch
    on visual studio code to test my understanding in web development so far. Enjoy!

      <p>A helpful cheatsheet to refer back to when making html tables. It would be handy
        to update this in the future as learn more skills. It is pretty time consuming 
        manually adding new entries on an html file. We'll see.

      <p>
        In this project, I be built a basic design system for a website. 
        Essentially, I was building a website to help build more websites in the future. 
        Here, I collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.
